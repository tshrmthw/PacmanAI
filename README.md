# PacmanAI

## Search - "GhostlessA*"
Implemetation of depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.


## Multi-Agent Search - "MinMaxAlphaBeta"
Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. Implementation includes multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.


## Reinforcement Learning - "MarkovandQAgent"
Implementation includes model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, applied to the AIMA textbook's Gridworld, Pacman, and a simulated crawling robot.


## Ghostbusters - "ParticleFilter"
Probabilistic inference in a hidden Markov model tracks the movement of hidden ghosts in the Pacman world. Implementation includes exact inference using the forward algorithm and approximate inference via particle filters.

## Classification - "ParticleFilter"
Implementation includes standard machine learning classification algorithms using Naive Bayes, Perceptron, and MIRA models to classify digits. Extention of this has been coded up as well by implementing a behavioral cloning Pacman agent.


##### Implementation of various AI techniques to solve pacman game with specific improvements on base code sections. It is part of CS188 AI course from UCB. More information on the base project can be found at http://ai.berkeley.edu/
