# PacmanAI

## Search - "GhostlessA*"
Implemetation of depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.


## Multi-Agent Search - "MinMaxAlphaBeta"
Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. Implementation includes multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.


## Reinforcement Learning - "MarkovandQAgent"
Implementation includes model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, applied to the AIMA textbook's Gridworld, Pacman, and a simulated crawling robot.


## Ghostbusters - "ParticleFilter"
Probabilistic inference in a hidden Markov model tracks the movement of hidden ghosts in the Pacman world. Implementation includes exact inference using the forward algorithm and approximate inference via particle filters.

## Classification - "ParticleFilter"
Implementation includes standard machine learning classification algorithms using Naive Bayes, Perceptron, and MIRA models to classify digits. Extention of this has been coded up as well by implementing a behavioral cloning Pacman agent.
